# p24
Set of tools for utilizing *Przelewy24* API.

The package contains `p24` module, which provides functions and constants 
for operating on *Przelewy24* API. It is based on the official documentation.
The code was tested on Python 3.4 but it should work on any 3.x version. Its
only requirement is the `requests` package.

**Please note** that `p24` is just a thin wrapper around the API and it
**does not** validate any of the input data.

## Installation

```
pip install p24
```

## Usage

Please read the code, as it's clear enough and the API is very simple.
 
## Further development
I wrote `p24` because I need it in my private projects, therefore it will be
fixed/extended only if I find it necessary. **However** if you are using this
package and you found a bug or you would like to see it updated or extended,
please let me know (or create a pull request).
